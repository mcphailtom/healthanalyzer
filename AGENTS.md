1. The project uses a Go, HTMX, Bubbletea stack with SQLlite for persistence.
2. Code should be succint, idiomatic and use as few external dependecies as possible
3. Documentation comments should be used as required but not as a replacement for readable code
4. All documentation lives in the docs folder and should be short and well scoped to a feature or problem
5. Unit tests use testify and mockery where needed and should use the testify suite constructs and table tests where possible
6. All code needs test coverage where practical and tests are to test requirements and should not be altered to make edge cases work rather the code needs to satisfy the requirments
7. All feature work should occur on a new branch with PRs to main.
